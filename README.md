# Beyond TEI: Metadata for Digital Humanities

Carolyn Hansen
NYCDH Week 2019

### Course Description

High-quality metadata is essential for the description, discovery, and preservation of DH projects. While TEI is the most used metadata standard in DH, there is so much more to learn and explore! This course will introduce metadata schemas and standards such as Dublin Core, VRA, controlled vocabularies, and linked data and RDF in the DH context. A demo of OpenRefine will be given showing metadata/data cleaning and creating custom schemas. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of how to structure metadata for their projects and how to use OpenRefine.

An extended version of this course was given at DHSI in 2017. For course materials, see: https://github.com/crowesn/beyond-tei
